# havenlyProj
Set up a webpack project to both serve a React site locally for development and build a bundle for production.

The development environment should include:

Support for CSS Modules
Hot Module Reloading
Proxying of asset requests to a different URL (you do not need to implement a dev server to respond to proxied requests, if they 404 that will be good enough).
Your production build config should include:

Dead code elimination
Any necessary polyfills
Code minification
Source maps
Feel free to copy and paste from any previous webpack configs you've done, but please do not use a pre-built template like create-react-app or react-slingshot.
